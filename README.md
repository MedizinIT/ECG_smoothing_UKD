We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data obtained from wearable EKGs, leveraging advanced techniques to visualize and interpret the findings. Our objective was to assess the quality of various evaluation runs and establish a reliable framework for comparing their effectiveness. By examining the data in conjunction with relevant clinical parameters, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the performance and reliability of different evaluation processes. This comprehensive approach allowed us to make informed judgments and draw meaningful conclusions regarding the accuracy and usability of the analyzed EKG data.
